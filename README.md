Greetings, thank you for taking the time to visit my profile. 

With a foundation in Telecommunication Engineering and Computer Science, I have over 4 years of experience in information security, specializing in third-party security assessments, vulnerability management, and security due diligence. My career began in networking and system administration, focusing on VoIP and Red Hat Linux, and has since evolved to encompass advanced areas of cybersecurity such as penetration testing, secure code review, and data breach protection. Additionally, I'm a certified Red Hat Engineer and a certified penetration tester.

## Objective

Currently serving as a Senior Security Specialist at Hyundai Motor APAC, I oversee, and lead efforts to secure business-critical systems, protect sensitive data, and assess third-party risks. My goal is to bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs, ensuring that security practices align with organizational objectives while mitigating risk.

Feel free to ping/email me for business inquiries (alfiendhika@protonmail.com)
